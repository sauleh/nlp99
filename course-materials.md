## Online Courses
This course closely follows Prof. Manning's [NLP with deep learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) course. There is an earlier version of the course with a more traditional approach by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning on Natural Language Processing which is also highly recommended. You can find the slides of the earlier version of the course [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/NLPCourseraSlides.html) and the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOFZnDyrlW3-nI7tMLtmiJZ&disable_polymer=true). Other online courses:
* From Languge to Information by Dan Jurafsky: [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_48v322owNVtORXuMeRmpA), course [page](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/).
* Food Talks: The Language of Food by Dan Jurafsky ([Course Page](http://web.stanford.edu/class/think53/))

Prof. Dan Jurafsky is a leading reasearcher and teacher in Natural Language Processing. You can find a list of courses taught by him [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/teaching.html).
